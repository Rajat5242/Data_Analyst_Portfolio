# Rajat's_Portfolio

Hi, I'm Rajat! I have a technical background and had completed my Bachelor's in Automobile Engineering from Acharya Institute of Technology.Being from the Science background , I have good command in Maths which ultimately results shows my statistical skills required for this domain. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analyst.

During my course of time, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience through various courses in data mining, data visualization, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio_Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

[Project-1: Second hand Car Correlation Project](https://github.com/Rajat5242/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Second%20hand%20car%20Correlation%20project%20.ipynb)
#### Description : The dataset contains the list of second hand cars from 1989 to 2021 which are currently are in sale in Australia. The record includes the Name of the car, its Brand , Price, Model, Kilometers driven, CC, etc.. The project includes Data loading, cleaning and preprocessing, EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis), analyzing correlation and performing hypothesis testing.
#### Technology : Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib
#### Result : Python functions to calculate and plot Price vs different features, hypothesis testing, detecting statistically significant result used to determine that Year and Name have the highest correlation. 

[Project-2 ; Data Analysis of Ambition Box website](https://github.com/Rajat5242/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Second%20hand%20car%20Correlation%20project%20.ipynb)
#### Description : I have performed Web Scrapping on the Ambition Box - List of Companies page to fetch this dataset. The record includes Company , Company type, Rating, Review, etc.. The project includes Web Scrapping, data loading, cleaning and preprocessing, EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis), analysing the data and hypothesis testing. 
#### Technology : Python, Beautiful Soup, Requests, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib.
#### Results : Python functions to calculate the Top Rated Companies, top Reviewed companies, Cities having maximum no. of Headquarters and many more. 

[Project-3 : Sentiment Analysis on Amazon food reviews dataset](https://github.com/Rajat5242/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/SENTIMENT%20ANALYSIS%20PROJECT%20.ipynb)
#### Description : This dataset contains the list of users who reviewed the food on amazon website. The record contains Id, UserId, ProductId, HelpfulnessNumerator, etc.. The project includes Data loading, cleaning and preprocessing, EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and analyzing the sentiment of each review by finding out the polarity and analyzing it.
#### Technology : Python, Pandas, Numpy, TextBlob and WordCloud.
#### Result : Using Python functions to calculate the positive , neutral and negative reviews in the dataset. Found positive comments much higher than negative comments.

[Second Hand car market in Australia](https://public.tableau.com/views/Australiansecondhandcarmarket/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
#### Description : Tableau Public dashboard consisted of : Calculated Total no. of Used cars and the different drve types. Donut chart highlighting the different Fuel types, Bar chart showing relation between Price and HP(Horsepower). Line chart showing relation between Price and Kilometer. Also added filters by Brand and Year.
#### Result : Interactive Dashboard
